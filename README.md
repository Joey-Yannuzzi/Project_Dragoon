## About the Game
### Genre

### Gameplay
Typical gameplay features the player attempting one of a few tasks.  The main feature of this game will be battling.  Players will travel a map of the world with their army and fight in skirmishes or full length, deadly battles.  As players play through the game, they will discover a need to grow their army, and will be able to recruit enemy soldiers to join the palyer's ranks.  Outside of battle, the player will need to maintain the morale, health, and equiptment of their army.  Players can even promote their soldiers, or upgrade their weapons to make them more powerful.

## Playing the Game
### How to Play
#### In Battles
##### Objectives
During battles, players are usually tasked with one main objective that will be present at all times, and a few side objectives, that are not absolutely nessesary to complete the battle.  The main objective can be in the form of survival, routing, capturing a point, or escaping to a location on the map.  The main objective is the only objective required in order to complete a level, however, side objectives will often contain rewards for daring players.  Side objectives include, recruiting powerful characters, opening treasure, and stealing valuable items from enemies.
##### Commanding the Army
The most important part of playing the game is a player commanding their army.  In every battle regardless of objectives, the player will need to move their soldiers, attack enemies or heal themselves or others in order to survive the battle.  Sometimes, the player will even notice a 'talk' command which opens the door to recruiting enemy or other allied soldiers to the player's army.
